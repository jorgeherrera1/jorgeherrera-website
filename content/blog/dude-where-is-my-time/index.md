title: Dude, where is my time?

Today's my first month after being a dad for the 1st time. Valentina is already 1 month old. She came to change my world in ways I had no idea. Learning a lot of what life means, learning what is like to be responsible for one life and do the best for her. Words are not enough to describe the feelings inside someone who is experimenting partenting for the 1st time. It's just awesome.

These unknown territories (parenting) have made me wander for days and days how world leaders in the world are able to be so productive with so little time. What's their secret? Is it just a matter of sacrifize all sleep? but if you sacrifize sleep, you will be mentally tired for the rest of the day which means you will not make the best calls, let alone that the quality time with your baby will be poor. There has to be a way.

... IN PROGRESS ...
